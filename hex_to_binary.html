    <h1>Converting Hexadecimal to Binary</h1>


    <p>
        In information technology a number base is the combination of digits used by a system of
        counting to represent specific numbers. Below I am going to demonstrate with aid of
        examples and diagrams how to convert hexadecimal to binary. I will briefly define both
        hexadecimal and binary
    </p>

    <h4 class="no-bottom-margin">What is hexadecimal?</h4>
    <p class="no-top-margin">
        Hexadecimal (which is frequently referred to as hex) is useful for representing larger
        numbers using fewer digits. It has 16 units and they are 0-9 and also the letters A,B,C,D,E
        and F.
    </p>

    <h4 class="no-bottom-margin">What is binary?</h4>
    <p class="no-top-margin">
        Binary is a base two number system which means It has two units. These units are (0-1).
        Binary is characterised by extremely long numbers that can be either 8, 16 or even 31- digits
        long! These numbers may be difficult for humans to read and follow however, they are
        essential in computer coding. Hexadecimal must be converted into binary for a computer or
        information system to be able to understand it. It is used every day in computer coding to
        represent data electronically.
    </p>


    <p>
        Although Hexadecimal is a complex number system, it can easily be converted into binary.
        Below I have included 5 steps that will show you exactly how this is done.
    </p>

    <p class="custom-margin-bottom">
        <ol>
            <li>
                Step one is to determine the hexadecimal number you are dealing with and
                convert their values (that are represented by numbers) to their decimal equivalent.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each individual hexadecimal digit represents four binary digits (as can be seen in
                the conversion table shown below) this in turn, means that each digit is equal to a
                power of two.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once you have understood this step you must now determine which one of the two
                powers can be added together to give you your hex digit (either 8,4,2 and 1). For
                example, if one of the hex values is 6 this means that 2 and 4 can be used in order
                to add up to your hex number which is 6. This leaves the powers 1 and 8 unused.
            </li>
            <li>
                To make things clear and easy to understand, you should write 1 beside the
                powers that are used (2 and 4 in our case.) and to write 0 beside the ones that are
                not used.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finally, if you order these numbers from left to right you should produce the
                binary conversion of your hexadecimal number
            </li>
            <li style="list-style: none; padding: 5px 0 5px 0">
                Results for example above: 6=0110
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
